Project Title : Training Deep Neural Networks with HSIC and
Backpropagation

The project explores an alternative training strategies that reduce reliance on global BP are increasingly being explored to address these limitations.
This paper proposes a simple archi-tecture that integrates Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) layers with linear layers, where the HSIC layers
are trained locally, and the linear layers are optimized using global BP. This hybrid approach mitigates the drawbacks of BP while enhancing the modelâ€™s
ability to learn complex features across multiple layers.
